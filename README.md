 Continuing a web-based personal project from a few years ago. Primarily using JavaScript and React, and I plan on integrating SQL

## So what is this project supposed to be?
In 2011, FromSoftware released a video game titled Dark Souls. In this game, you fight a variety of enemies try to survive in a tough as nails world, leveling up your stats as you go. These stats can increase your survivability in this world, and they can raise the damage a weapon your character is using can put. These weapons can be upgraded, can do different types of damage, and some even scale differently based on the stat you decide to level. However, these stats cannot be refunded without a hefty price, or at all in some cases.
Also known as Attack Rating, or AR, this is the projected damage a weapon your character is wielding could do to an enemy. This project is created with the intention of helping other players figure out the AR of their weapon without having to potentially ruin their character.

## Do you have any extended plans for this?
Yes, I do! When I'm done with the details pertaining to the first Dark Souls game, I plan on extending this project to cover the other two games in the trilogy, and even other FromSoftware games with similar mechanics like Bloodborne or the recently released Elden Ring.
